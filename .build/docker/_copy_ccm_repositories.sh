# prepopulate a tmp ccm repository directory from whats already in the image
#
# the image has all versions and branches in ~/.ccm/repository already
# the container doesn't re-use ~/.ccm/repository so to avoid any writes in the containerfs
# so we rsync what's important from ~/.ccm/repository to the configured ${CCM_CONFIG_DIR}
# this appears to take a long time, but should be faster than ccm downloading
# rsync is used as it's the friendlier approach against open file ulimits
