/**
 * The common base class for query execution plan nodes.
 * The top-level node is considered to be the execution plan of the query.
 *
 * <h1>Structure</h1>
 * A query plan is an immutable tree constisting of nodes representing physical data operations,
 * e.g. index scans, intersections, unions, filtering, limiting, sorting, etc.
 * Nodes of type {@link KeysIteration} operate on streams of keys, and nodes of type {@link RowsIteration} operate
 * on streams of rows. You should build a plan bottom-up by using static methods in {@link Plan.Factory}.
 * Nodes don't have pointers to parent nodes on purpose – this way multiple plans can share subtrees.
 *
 * <h1>Cost estimation</h1>
 * A plan can estimate its execution cost and result set size which is useful to select the best plan among
 * the semantically equivalent candidate plans. Operations represented by nodes may be pipelined, so their actual
 * runtime cost may depend on how many rows are read from the top level node. Upon construction, each plan node
 * gets an {@link Access} object which describes the way how the node results are going to be used by the parent nodes:
 * how many rows will be requested or what skip operations are going to be performed on the iterator.
 * The access objects get propagated down the tree to the leaves. This way we get an accurate cost of execution
 * at the leave nodes, taking into account any top-level limit or intersections.
 * <p>
 * Some nodes cannot be pipelined, e.g. nodes that represent sorting. To make cost estimation for such nodes possible,
 * each node maintains an initial cost (initCost) of the operation - that is the cost of preparation before the first
 * result row or key can be returned. Sorting nodes can have that cost very high.
 *
 * <h1>Optimization</h1>
 * This class also offers a few methods for modifying the plans (e.g. removing nodes) and a method allowing
 * to automatically improve the plan – see {@link #optimize()}. Whenever we talk about "modification" or "updates"
 * we always mean constructing a new plan. All updates are non-destructive. Each node has a unique numeric
 * identifier in the tree. Because a modification requires creating some new nodes, identifiers allow to find
 * corresponding nodes in the modified plan, even if they addresses changed (they are different java objects).
 *
 * <h1>Execution</h1>
 * The plan tree may store additional context information to be executable, i.e. to produce the iterator over the result
 * keys or rows - see {@link KeysIteration#execute}. However, the purpose of the plan nodes is not to perform
 * the actual computation of the result set. Instead, it should delegate the control to other modules responsible
 * for data retrieval. The plan only sets up the execution, but must not contain the execution logic.
 * For the sake of good testability, plan trees must be creatable, estimatable and optimizable also without
 * creating any of the objects used by the execution engine.
 *
 * <h1>Example</h1>
 * The CQL query
 * <pre>
 * SELECT * FROM table WHERE  a < 0.01 AND b < 0.2 LIMIT 10
 * </pre>
 *
 * can be represented by the following query execution plan:
 * <pre>
 * Limit 10 (rows: 10.0, cost/row: 265.2, cost: 80.0..2732.2)
 *  └─ Filter a < 0.2 AND b < 0.01 (sel: 1.000000000) (rows: 10.0, cost/row: 265.2, cost: 80.0..2732.2)
 *      └─ Fetch (rows: 10.0, cost/row: 265.2, cost: 80.0..2732.2)
 *          └─ Intersection (keys: 10.0, cost/key: 58.2, cost: 80.0..662.1)
 *              ├─ NumericIndexScan of vector_b_idx using Expression{ ... } (sel: 0.010010000, step: 1.0) (keys: 50.2, cost/key: 1.0, cost: 40.0..90.2)
 *              └─ NumericIndexScan of vector_a_idx using Expression{ ... } (sel: 0.199230000, step: 19.9) (keys: 50.2, cost/key: 10.6, cost: 40.0..571.9)
 * </pre>
